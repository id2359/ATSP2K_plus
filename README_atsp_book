This package is similar to the package described in the
book, "Computational Atomic Structure: An MCHF approach"
by C. Froese Fischer, Tomas Brage, and Per J\"onsson, but has
been modified and extended in a number of ways:

   1) extended to arbitrarily filled f-shells
   2) modified for fully orthogonal methodology (NO NON-ORTHOGONALITY!)
   3) modified for more efficient evaluation of matrix elements
   4) modified for sparse matrix methods using the Davidson algorithm
   5) extended for optimization on multiple terms or eigenvalues
   6) modified for efficient calculations of iso-electronic sequences
   7) modified to use biorthogonal transformations for transitions
   8) modified for Message passing (MPI) versions of the code
 
Modifications published in this version were performed by the following:
  Sparse methods:             C. Froese Fischer  and her group
                                 (email: Charlotte.F.Fischer@Vanderbilt.edu
  Angular Integration:        Gediminas Gaigalas (email: gaigalas@itpa.lt)
  Radial and MPI codes:       Georgio Tachiev    (email: georgio@arc.fiu.edu)
  Nonorthogonal transitions:  Michel Godefroid   (email: mrgodef@ulb.ac.be)

#                       INSTALLATION

# 1. For installation the package requires several environmental 
#    variables to be correctly initialized as described below.  
# 
# 2. To compile go to src and type "make"
# 3. the binaries will be compiled in ${ATSP}/bin
# 4. The libraries will be compiled in ${ATSP}/lib
# 5.  If code for 64 bit architectures is needed, the library file
#     src/lib/libcom/alloc_LINUX_64.f should be copied to 
#     src/lib/libcom/alloc_LINUX.f
# 
# To compile biotr_ang and biotr_tr (which split the biotr calculation)
# go to src90 and type "make"


Below is an example of variables being set in a .cshrc file with the use
of a Portland Group Fortran compiler.  For a more general discussion, 
consult the CPC publication.
