Dynamic memory management
</H1>
Memory management is an important factor for increasing the 
limits of the <TT>mchf calculation</TT>, and it has been accomplished
mainly in two directions. First, between the two phases of 
an <TT>scf()</TT> iteration, arrays can share memory, and secondly
the memory is allocated based on size and frequency of use in 
CPU intensive processes.

<P>
The SCF process has two phases which are totally disjoint, 
the array of contributions to the energy functional, and 
the array of integral values may share the same memory.

<OL>
<LI>In the orbital update phase, the appropriate view of the
energy functional is given by Eq. (3). To compute the potential and/or
exchange function for a specified orbital, say <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img81.png"
 ALT="$a$">, it is necessary to
search the list for integrals involving orbital <IMG
 WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="17" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img81.png"
 ALT="$a$">. When an integral is
found, its contribution needs to be determined and multiplied by
<IMG
 WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img82.png"
 ALT="$w_{ab}$"> or <IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img83.png"
 ALT="$v_{abcd;k}$">.  Thus in this phase the values of the
integrals themselves are not needed, only the coefficient defining their
contribution to the energy.                                                  
Since these coefficients depend on
eigenvectors, they need to be re-computed before the orbital update phase.
In the present implementation, it occurs after the diagonalization process.
</LI>
<LI>In the matrix diagonalization phase, the matrix elements as defined by
Eq (2) need to be assembled, in order,  as described earlier.  Now the value of
the integrals are needed but not their total contribution to the energy
functional. Thus, before the diagonalization phase, all integrals need
to be re-evaluated.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
To maximize the memory
utilization, the storage of all arrays is allocated in a
stepwise fashion. Upon memory allocation failure, the remaining
arrays are stored on disk. Under this scheme the order in which arrays are
allocated becomes important and the arrays used most frequently at each
SCF iteration are allocated first.
The angular coefficient data and the interaction matrix are the
two major data structures which define the memory use for each
scf iteration.  As the number of configurations grows the
memory capacity may be exceeded thus requiring some or most of  the
data to be stored on disk.
Disk read/write operations are then performed on each SCF and DVDSON
iteration. Disk read/write access is considerably slower compared to
memory access.  In order to accomplish high computational
efficiency it is essential to avoid
disk I/O and keep all data in memory. Therefore,
optimizing <TT>mchf</TT>  for large
scale calculations requires management of the disk/memory data storage.
In general, the angular coefficients, the interaction matrix elements and
the associated pointers are stored in one dimensional arrays.
The arrays of angular coefficients are considerably larger than the
interaction matrix.

<P>
The memory allocation process (<TT>alcsts</TT>), starts with Level 4 and
upon success on each level may proceed up to Level 1.
At Level 4, if no memory is available for performing Dvdson
iterations on disk (vector-matrix
multiplication on disk) the program exits. (This will represent a very
large case beyond practical limits for serial computing: in the order of
millions of cfgs). If the program cannot proceed with allocating
memory for the interaction matrix of the largest block, a similar, local
scheme (in <TT>diag</TT>) is used to allocate memory for each  block. Blocks can
vary significantly in size and in order to improve the performance <TT>mchf</TT>
is designed to keep smaller blocks in memory if possible.

<P>
As shown in table &nbsp;<A HREF="node53.html#tab:mem">6.3</A>,  
levels 1, 2, and 3 <TT>ico</TT> has higher priority
compared to <TT>coeff</TT> and <TT>inptr</TT> because <TT>ico</TT> is used in both
<TT>diag</TT> and <TT>updatc</TT> routines. However, it is important to note that
<TT>updatc</TT> proceeds almost always in memory since all of the memory
used in <TT>diag_hmx</TT> and <TT>dvdson</TT> is deallocated and made available.

<P>
The memory allocation procedure relies on <TT>malloc()</TT> and <TT>free()</TT>,
which are <TT>C</TT> routines normally used for dynamic memory management.
<TT>malloc()</TT> allocates <EM>size</EM> bytes and returns a pointer to the
allocated memory. If the request fails <TT>malloc()</TT> returns a
<B><TT>NULL</TT></B> pointer. The atsp2K package includes the routines <TT>alloc()</TT>
and <TT>dalloc()</TT> which use a similar approach, however upon failure
<TT>alloc()</TT> aborts by calling <TT>EXIT()</TT>. <TT>mchf</TT> has
several levels of memory allocation requiring the returned pointer to be
monitored in order to adjust the subsequent memory requests. For this purpose
two routines specific only to <TT>mchf</TT> have been introduced: <TT>diag_allocate() </TT> and <TT>diag_deallocate()</TT>. If the memory is not
sufficient for loading the array under consideration in the
memory, then, memory for the largest column of that array is allocated and the
array is stored on disk.
