Methods</A>
</H2>
The wave functions for both initial and final states were 
determined using the nonrelativistic multiconfgiurational 
Hartree-Fock (MCHF) approach. The wave functions were built 
from a basis of one-electron spin-orbital functions and were 
expanded in terms of configuration state functions (CSF). In 
order to keep the calculations in reasonable bounds the 
method of Restrictive Active Space (RAS) was applied. The 
size of the active sets (characterized by the largest principal 
quantum number, n) was incremented until a convergence of both 
the LS transition energy and the two forms of LS line 
strength were achieved.

<P>
In the Breit-Pauli approximation, terms for a specific J value 
interact, and this requires that mixing effects between  
terms be considered. The traditional MCHF method was 
modified to permit a simultaneous optimization of the weighted 
energy expressions derived from multiple terms. This 
allowed a single orbital set to represent a choice of terms with 
strong relativistic mixing. Then, by diagonalization 
of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian a few selected eigenvalues 
were determined. The bi-orthonormal method was applied to 
compute the transition data.
