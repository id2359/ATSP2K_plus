Computing the wave functions using <TT>MCHF</TT></A>
</H1>
In the MCHF approach, the first step is to find an
approximate wave function for the initial and final states of
an atomic system.  An energy criterion is used for this 
purpose and once a wave function has been determined, then
a number of atomic properties can be computed including  
also relativistic effects.
Figure &nbsp;<A HREF="node21.html#run1">2.2</A> is more a detailed version of Figure
&nbsp;<A HREF="node18.html#atsp_general">2.1</A> and includes information about the
applications and intermediate files in each major step.

Computing wave functions for the initial and final states. 
Initially, <TT>hf</TT> gives
an estimate for the <TT>n=3</TT>. The angular data is Z independent
and for each <TT>n</TT> computed only once. For each Z <TT>mchf</TT> 
computes the wave functions.

<P>
Normally, an <TT>mchf</TT> calculation starts at <TT>n=3</TT>.
In order to start the calculation with good initial
estimates, an average energy Hartree-Fock calculation is performed.
Providing initial estimates for <TT>n=3</TT> from <TT>hf</TT>  
is an optional but a worthwhile step to
ensure good initial estimates for the correlation calculation.
The script below shows a way of using the <TT>hf</TT> program, the 
comments on the right side explain the expected input:

<P>
<PRE>
set -x

# this script runs the Hartree-Fock program and for average energies
# and saves the output wave function file in E1.${Z}_2.w, which
# will be used as initial estimates at n=3 for the mchf calculation
# the file shows runs for Z=8,9, for different Z the line below 
# should be modified:

for Z in  8 9 #10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
do
   (echo
   rm wfn.inp
${ATSP}/bin/hf &lt;&lt;EOF
N,AV,${Z}         # Atom label, Average energy, Atomic number
  1s              # closed shells
2s(1)2p(4)        # electrons outside closed shells
all               # optimize on all orbitals
y                 # default electron parameters
y                 # default remaining parameters
n                 # 
n
EOF
   mv wfn.out E1.${Z}_2.w)    # wfn.out is moved
done
rm *log
</PRE>

<P>
The script demonstrates the <TT>hf</TT> calculation only for 
<TT>Z=8,9</TT>, however, it is easily extendible for higher <TT>Z</TT>.
By default <TT>hf</TT> saves the resulting wave function in 
a file <TT>wfn.out</TT> and the script further renames it to incorporate
the group and atomic number in the file name. Since this file is used 
as initial estimate for <TT>mchf</TT> at <TT>n=3</TT>, it is convenient to 
use number 2 in the file name (the <TT>mchf</TT> script starts at n=3
and expects an initial estimate from n=2). 

<P>
When a range of mchf calculations is desired, it is convenient to 
encode the algorithm shown in Figure &nbsp;<A HREF="node21.html#run1">2.2</A> into a shell script. 
In this case, the calculations for <TT>n=3,4,5,6,...</TT> and 
for the desired set of atomic numbers <TT>Z=8,9,...</TT> are included.
The script starts with assigning values for terms, eigenvalues,
optimization of orbitals and other parameters as required by <TT>mchf</TT>. 
Note that the main loop is over each <TT>n</TT> and 
the internal loop for a given <TT>n</TT> is over each <TT>Z</TT>. 
The script assumes all files are in the current directory, except 
the configuration lists for the terms. 
They are common to all groups and are located in a separate directory,
<TT>file_c</TT>. An expansion for a given term has the
name <TT>LSn.c</TT>.  For example, the expansion for <TT><IMG
 WIDTH="26" HEIGHT="20" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img28.png"
 ALT="$^4P$"></TT> 
and <TT>n=3</TT> has been
saved in the file  <TT>files_c/4P3.c</TT>.  In order to avoid name conflicts 
with even terms with the same LS, the odd parity is denoted as "o" in the 
file name (<TT>4Po3.c</TT>).
A script like the above assumes calculations are robust,
that no errors are encountered. The user should inspect the output 
for potential errors.

<P>
The script utilizes  <TT>nonh and mchf</TT>, but it is preferable 
to look upon the needs and I/O data separately for each one. 

<P>
<TT>nonh</TT> requires <TT>cfg.inp</TT> to be present in the current 
working directory.  All parameters in  <TT>nonh</TT> are default. 
The only input file is <TT>cfg.inp</TT>, which is required. 
While processing the configuration lists, <TT>nonh</TT>  prints out
important reference information which can be used to detect
possible errors or deviations from the desired procedures: number 
of orbitals, number of closed shells, number of integrals, number of
configurations. The same information is repeated for 
each term.  <TT>nonh</TT> can be run interactively without 
providing any input: 

<P>
<PRE>
%nonh
</PRE>
Thus, the output of correctly running <TT>nonh</TT> (at <TT>n=4</TT>)
is similar to:

<P>
<PRE>
%nonh
 input file is cfg.inp ...

After <TT>nonh</TT>, <TT>mchf</TT> continues with computing the radial 
wave functions.  Step wise <TT>mchf</TT> calculations with respect to 
<TT>n</TT> and good initial estimates are one of the most important 
factors for correct results and faster convergence of <TT>mchf</TT>
calculations. The wave function at <TT>n-1</TT> is used as
an optional initial estimate and it is copied into <TT>wfn.inp</TT>.
<TT>mchf</TT> reads <TT>wfn.inp</TT> provided that it is present in the current
working directory. The script must have a consistent way 
to refer each needed file and to save results from each 
<TT>n and Z</TT> step into a unique file. After converging <TT>mchf</TT> 
saves the output wave function by default to <TT>wfn.out</TT>, and further, 
the scripts renames it to a file with name comprised by the name of the
group, <TT>Z and n</TT>. In addition to the wave function saved in file 
<TT>wfn.out</TT>, the eigenvectors are computed and saved in <TT>LS.l</TT> 
files by default, which  the script renames to a unique file name from
a combination of  <TT>LS</TT> term, <TT>Z and n</TT> information.

<P>
The user is responsible for providing
correct initial estimate of the wave function. This becomes  
more difficult for runs covering multiple <TT>n and Z</TT>. Shell scripts
should be prepared with care. Correct shell makes the calculation
easier and reduce the error, however, they may propagate multiple 
errors.

<P>
In interactive mode the user must provide a number of

<P>
In the first line, <TT>mchf</TT> program, expects a label (Z=9, in this 
case), followed by the atomic number.  Then, for each
term, the user is asked to specify the index of the desirable
eigenvalue and its weight.  For example, to compute the first
eigenvalue, with weight 1.0, and the second with weight 0.5,
say, the input data would be 1(1.0), 2(0.5).  In the present
case both are the lowest with the default weight of 1.  Again,
it may not be necessary to optimize only the orbitals for which
there are no initial estimates provided. 
So in this case, we optimize only on the last 9 orbitals, or
all <TT>n=2,3</TT>  orbitals.

<P>
<TT>mchf</TT> processes all CPU intensive calculations in memory,
however the program has the capability to switch to disk storage,
if the memory is insufficient for all arrays. The major
arrays are: c.lst (coefficient data), ih and ico (pointer data)
and <TT>hmx</TT> (matrix elements) and the output shows if 
all arrays are in the memory, or which ones are on disk, this 
can help the user to optimize the speed of an <TT>mchf</TT> 
calculation.  CPU intensive calculations for data
stored on disk could be considerably slower compared to 
data storage in memory. The output above shows that all four arrays
are in memory.  

<P>
In the course of an <TT>mchf</TT> calculation the change in the weighted
energy and the total energy are displayed after each iteration. 
Poor models or 
optimization strategies (LS terms or weights) may result in 
oscillation of the total energy, or very slow convergence. The 
user needs to monitor the change <TT>DeltaE</TT> and the total energy 
<TT>Sum_Energy</TT> and should modify the script if the optimization
does not proceed as expected. Those two parameters are printed to
<TT>stderr, or UNIT=0</TT>. In the script described
earlier the output <TT>stdout</TT> from <TT>mchf</TT> is redirected to a separate
file for each <TT>mchf</TT> run. It contains more extensive information with
intermediate results for each iteration and the user should review it
carefully for errors or unexpected events. The output from <TT>stderr</TT>
only prints the energy convergence.

<P>
Assuming that the output of <TT>stdout</TT> has been saved to a file
<TT>out_O1.9-4</TT>, <TT>"grep Sum out_O1.9-4"</TT> will provide 
the weighted total energy after each iteration:

the energy convergence of each <TT>LS</TT> term, including some details
of the performance of the Davidson program after computing the eigenvalues

Those  are  valuable quick checks on the convergence patterns during 
and after an <TT>mchf</TT> run for each <TT>LS</TT> term and for the total 
energy without interrupting the program.
In the next step of the <TT>mchf</TT> cycle, we again move the 
<TT>wfn.out</TT> to <TT>wfn.inp</TT> and perform a calculation on the 
next <TT>n</TT>..  

<P>
Upon successful completion the iteration over each <TT>Z and n</TT>,
a set of files is saved: <TT>*.w, out*, *.s</TT>, and a number of
<TT>.l</TT> files corresponding to the number of terms. 
Multiple eigenvectors for the same LS term are saved in a single 
<TT>.l</TT> file. Note that in addition to energy, coefficient 
and electron data, each *.l contains the specific mass shift 
parameter <TT>Ssms</TT>.

In addition to the wave functions, and eigenvectors, <TT>mchf</TT> writes many 
orbital parameters to <TT>summry</TT> file.  Each <TT>summry</TT> file is saved to a
file with a suffix .s and a base name consistent with the wave function
file name.
