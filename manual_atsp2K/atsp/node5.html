Introduction</A>
</H1>
The main goal of the Website is to store and allow acces to the world
to accurate atomic transition data for light atoms. The data
have been computed and analyzed at Vanderbilt University under the 
direction of Prof. Charlotte F. Fischer. The computational schemes 
include correlation and relativistic effects, through Breit-Pauli 
interactions. The data are organized by sequences and by atoms,
Figure &nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#fig:coll">3.5</A>,  and are accessible through the main
page at <PRE> 
http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~cff/mchf_collection/
</PRE>,
which displays the Periodic Table. In addition to 
Atomic data, the Web site contains source code, an interactive
version of the <TT>hf</TT> program and information relevant to 
the computational methods utilized for mass production.

Goals</A>
</H2>
By conducting systematic large-scale relativistic studies of a
portion of the spectra including the ground state, the MCDHF/MCHF
Collection aims at creating accurate ab initio collection of
atomic transition data of the light atoms
A detailed agreement between ab initio methods for computing atomic
spectroscopic data and experiment requires the relativistic effects 
to be included even in light atoms. In addition, fine structure 
levels, inter-combination lines, and lifetimes of some levels can be 
accurately determined only by considering the relativistic effects 
(spin-orbit, spin-spin, and spin-other-orbit) and all computed data
have included them.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00522000000000000000">
Methods</A>
</H2>
The wave functions for both initial and final states were 
determined using the nonrelativistic multiconfgiurational 
Hartree-Fock (MCHF) approach. The wave functions were built 
from a basis of one-electron spin-orbital functions and were 
expanded in terms of configuration state functions (CSF). In 
order to keep the calculations in reasonable bounds the 
method of Restrictive Active Space (RAS) was applied. The 
size of the active sets (characterized by the largest principal 
quantum number, n) was incremented until a convergence of both 
the LS transition energy and the two forms of LS line 
strength were achieved.

<P>
In the Breit-Pauli approximation, terms for a specific J value 
interact, and this requires that mixing effects between  
terms be considered. The traditional MCHF method was 
modified to permit a simultaneous optimization of the weighted 
energy expressions derived from multiple terms. This 
allowed a single orbital set to represent a choice of terms with 
strong relativistic mixing. Then, by diagonalization 
of the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian a few selected eigenvalues 
were determined. The bi-orthonormal method was applied to 
compute the transition data.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00523000000000000000">
Results</A>
</H2>. 
The MCDHF/MCHF Collection contains extensive transition data 
currently for seven isoelectronic sequences (LI, Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne). 
The method of simultaneous optimization considerably enhanced the means of 
computing a common radial basis when many terms exhibit 
relativistic mixing effects. The method allows for a simultaneous 
optimization of the weighted energy functional of a set of selected 
terms and eigenvalues. Applying the Breit-Pauli corrections 
included the relativistic effects. The accuracies of the 
transition energy, rates and lifetimes were compared with some 
high precision experiments and benchmark studies. The transition 
energies compared to the observed were accurate within a 
fraction of percent, and the accuracy of the transition rates was 
very often less than 1data were evaluated based on discrepancies between observed and 
theoretical energy, and the velocity and length forms of line strength.

Hartree-Fock Program</A>
</H1> A web interfaced interactive 
version of the Hartree-Fock program can be accessed by clicking
on the link HF Program. 
Additionally, the user can read the theory behind the <TT>hf</TT> program.
The Hartree-Fock program is a Java interfaced FORTRAN program
which is installed on hf5.

Note to the system administrator of hf5:
If problem occurs with the <TT>hf</TT> program on the Web,

Both, the Apache server and the <TT>hf</TT> Java server are configured to 
automatically start upon rebooting of the node hf5. While the 
scripts for the Apache server are default in the RedHat 7.1 installation 
and have not been modified, the <TT>hf</TT> Java server startup script
is executed in <TT>/etc/rc.local</TT> (this script starts the local services).
<TT>/etc/rc.local</TT> starts the <TT>hf</TT> Java server by executing the 
script <TT>/var/www/html/sh_start_HFapplet_server</TT>. Note that 
in order to start the <TT>hf</TT> Java server it is sufficient to 
execute as a root:
